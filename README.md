# Task3
this is a (not so) beautiful project that I just coded (10/11/2022). The task required filtering data, using javascript to show dynamic content and styling with CSS 
and a bit of bootstrap.
I know many things could be solved using just one or two lines of code, but I'm currently learning and the most important thing when doing so is that your
project works, and this does (hopefully)
Greetings from the past!!!
